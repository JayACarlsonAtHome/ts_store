# ts_store Event Flags

All per-event routing, severity, and status flags are stored in a single size_t (uint64_t) (host byte order in memory).  
Big-endian conversion is applied **only** during serialization to disk or network.

Bits are numbered from LSB (Bit 0) to MSB (Bit 63).

| Bit(s) | Flag Name        | Description                                                                                                                    | Set By    | Use Case                                                                                   | Notes / Default                  |

| 59     | IsResult         | Marks event as a structured result/metric rather than traditional log                                                          | User      | Distinguishes result events for special handling (e.g., separate UI tab, different retention) | Default: 0                       |
