# ts_store Event Flags

All per-event routing, severity, and status flags are stored in a single 64-bit word (`uint64_t` in host byte order).  
Big-endian conversion is applied **only** during serialization to disk or network.

Bits are numbered from LSB (Bit 0) to MSB (Bit 63).

| Bit(s)      | Flag Name          | Description                                                                                                                    | Set By   | Use Case                                                                                   | Notes / Default                  |
